Feel free to reach out to us to understand our process while taking on the task of replication of an already accomplished work
by RÃ¼diger Birkner, Dana Drachsler-Cohen, Laurent Vanbever, Martin Vechev as part of our Curricullum. We tried to capture the 
essence of work already done by the authors of Net2Text: Query-Guided Summarization of Network Forwarding Behaviors. 

Let us know if we could extend the scope of our replication of the work and/or improve our implementation.
